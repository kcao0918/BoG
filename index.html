            <p class="description">Hey my name is Kenny Cao and I am a second year computer science major focusing on System
                Architecture and Intelligence. Throughout high school I spent a lot of time doing volunteering outside of 
                school and I hope to continue that with Bits of Good. In my free time, I enjoy binging movie recaps on 
                youtube (either because I'm too scared or lazy to watch them) and solving chess puzzles. I am originally from Queens, New York and I transferred
                here just recently so I am still trying to get to know the area.
